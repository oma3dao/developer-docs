# How to Register an App

Anyone can mint a new application token using the OMA3 Application Registry.

## Steps

1. Go to [appregistry.oma3.org](https://appregistry.oma3.org)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click **Register App**
4. Fill in the required metadata fields
5. Sign the transaction using your wallet

## Notes

- OMA3 will soon host a service for hosting metadata such as `dataUrl`, `icon`, and `screenshots`, simplifying the registration process.
- Developers are encouraged to read the [IWPS Specification](https://github.com/oma3dao/iwps-specification) for integration guidance.
- Apps may also be verified using OMA3's Reputation Service in the future.
