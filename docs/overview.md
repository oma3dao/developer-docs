# App Registry Overview

The OMA3 Application Registry is a **blockchain-based, permissionless registry of applications** designed to replace centralized app store databases. Instead of relying on proprietary app store servers, this registry enables anyone to **mint an application token**, which can then be displayed and launched by compatible apps and websites.

These app tokens are decentralized, discoverable, and interoperable across the open metaverse. Apps, games, and services that support the **Inter-World Portaling System (IWPS)** can query these tokenized applications and present them to users through immersive storefronts, developer portals, or other interface layers.
